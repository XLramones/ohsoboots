				<h2>so what exactly is all this?</h2>
				<p>the goal of this website is to be an active and interactive space where by new goodies are also worked on constantly! it is currently written in pure and bare bones html, css and javascript, meaning i built it completely from scratch!</p>
- daily pic
<p>this is a handpicked(by yours truly) picture from memorabke events in the past year :)))) you can find them on the home page</p>

- vows
<p>vows are the forever promises we are going to make to each other one day, and id like to think that we shouldnt wait till then to make and keep them. this way we can also start preparing for our wedding in advance :)). Ive constructed i simple little thing where if you think of a dedication/promise/vow, we can save it there for us to see and remember. just write it and sign you name in the other box.</p>

- year
<p>this is a program that goes back into photos from my camera roll us us together and picks one from a point in time with the same date as today! just a random piccy. i dont choose them, and some days there wont be any (becuase we werent together)</p>


<h2>future !!!?</h2>
<p>i am hoping to add features such as</p>
<ul>
<li>games!!!</li>
<li>an digital archive of all our precious {meta}physical things like notes and acorns and poems and everything we can think of</li>
<li>other suuperisissses with our photos :::)</li>
</ul>
